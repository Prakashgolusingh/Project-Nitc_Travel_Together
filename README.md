<h1> What we have done</h1></br>This project gives students a proper platform to plan a travel in a comfortable
and affordable way with fellow students. It is based on making a journey with
a group of fellow students in which the charges of the journey get split between the
co-passengers. Also we provide so many options such as choosing food according to the user's convenience.
